# VectorsProject
It's just a training C# project with my two own structs: Vector2 and Vector3

Making this unit I had learned:
-How to make structures
-How to make indexators
-How to make immutable types
-How to override operators + - * / == != < > <= >= 
-How to override implicit operator
-How to throw exceptions
